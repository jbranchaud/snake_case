### Week 3: City Walking

Starting in the Northwest corner of a 2 block by 2 block city center, you
want to move to the Southeast corner. By moving only East and South a block
at a time, there are 6 paths through the city center.  How many paths are
there if the city center is 20 blocks by 20 blocks? How many paths are there
if you can only move at most two blocks in a given direction at a time?

### Week 2: Vim Buffer

I open up a new Vim buffer and type all the numbers 1 to 10,000, separated
by spaces. Then, my cat walks on the keyboard and somehow activates a
substitution command that replaces all the '0' digits (zeros) with spaces.
If I now sum up all the numbers in the buffer, as delineated by spaces, what
is the total?

### Week 1: Round Robin

Given 3 teams (A, B, C), we want to organize a tournament schedule such that
every team plays every other team exactly once. Here is a valid schedule for
these 3 teams: A-B, B-C, A-C. How about if we have N teams? Devise a
general-purpose algorithm that generates tournament schedules for N teams.
