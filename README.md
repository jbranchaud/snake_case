### Week 2: Vim Buffer

I open up a new Vim buffer and type all the numbers 1 to 10,000, separated
by spaces. Then, my cat walks on the keyboard and somehow activates a

### Week 1: Round Robin

Given 3 teams (A, B, C), we want to organize a tournament schedule such that
every team plays every other team exactly once. Here is a valid schedule for
these 3 teams: A-B, B-C, A-C. How about if we have N teams? Devise a
general-purpose algorithm that generates tournament schedules for N teams.
